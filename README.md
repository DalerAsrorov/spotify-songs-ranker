## User Flow
* The user searches the app through the URL (https://spotify-songs-ranker.com/)
* The user sees a search box that the user can type in and press "Enter"
* The search suggests the potential search results at the dropdown menu
* The user selects the artist from the dropdown and presses "Enter"
* The user sees the artist logo and name
* The user also sees the top 100 songs (scrollable)
